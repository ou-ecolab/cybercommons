# Note: mm 19-1-2022:
# For testing we switch to a temporary branch of ecopadq 
# (Here called 'test' indicated by the '@test' at the end of the commented github url above) 
# Since the celery worker installs the package from github we have
# to commit every change and restart the celery container for the change to take effect.
# Most of these commits will not achieve what we wanted and the commit history of the branch we use
# will get messed up. 
# Since we do not want this to happen to the master branch, we 
# collect all the uninformative commits in a temporary branch. 
# (which we can locally create by "git branch test")
# After we have achieved our goal with maybe the 20th commit to the testbranch
# we rewrite it's history by 'squash'-ing all the tiny commits 
# into one sensible commit with a descriptive commit message as described here.
#
# https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History
#
# Then we merge this one commit into the master branch of ecopadq and change the
# CELERY_SOURCE variable back to the url without the '@test'.
# Then we remove the test branch locally and remotely.
# by (inside ecopadq dir) 
# git branch rm test
# git push origin --delete test
