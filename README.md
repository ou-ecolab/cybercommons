Cybercommons API 
=======
The Cybercommons framework is a Django Rest Framework API. The API leverages MongoDB to provide a Catalog and Data Store for storing metadata and data within a JSON document database. The API also includes Celery which is an asynchronous task queue/jobs based on distributed message passing.

    * `pip install docker-compose`
* GNU Make or equivalent

## Installation

1. Edit values within dc_config/cybercom_config.env
1. Copy secrets_template.env into secrets.env under the same folder and add required credentials into it. 
1. Initialize database and generate internal SSL certs

    ```sh
    make init
    ```    
1. Build and Deploy on local system.

    ```sh
